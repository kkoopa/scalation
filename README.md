#SCALAble SimulaTION - ScalaTion

Welcome to **ScalaTion**, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics.

This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'tableau', 'event', 'process', 'dynamics', 'dynamics_pde', 'activity' and 'state' oriented models.

Scala is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language that is well-suited for developing simulation engines. It is in the Java family of languages and can call Java code. The inclusion of advanced and functional programming capabilities, makes the code much more concise than Java.

ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.
Some of the algorithms come in both sequential and parallel versions.

The **ScalaTion 1.2** version defines multiple .par subpackages that contain parallel versions of sequential algorithms.
Future directions include completing the 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<pre><code>
$ tar xvfz scalation_1.2.tar.gz <br> <b>OR</b> <br>
$ unzip scalation_1.2.zip
</code></pre>

## Usage

To compile code or run apps, enter sbt and type compile, run-main or exit

$ cd scalation_1.2 <br>
$ sbt <br>
> compile <br>
> run-main apps.process.Bank <br>
> run-main scalation.analytics.RegressionTest <br>
> exit



ScalaTion 1.2 is set up to use the Simple Build Tool <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org">sbt</a>.


ScalaTion 1.2 uses the following build specification file
<a href = "build.sbt">build.sbt</a>.
Source packages are in the <b>src/main/scala</b> directory,
class files are in the <b>target/scala-2.12.0-M2/classes</b> directory, and
documentation files are in the <b>target/scala-2.12.0-M2/api</b> directory.
Data file input, output or analytics are stored in subdirectories of <b>data</b>,
while database files are stored in <b>store</b>.

### To develop using an IDE:
<ol>
<li>
Download <a href = "http://typesafe.com/stack/downloads/scala-ide">Scala IDE for Eclipse</a>
<li>
Extract the downloaded .zip/.tar.gz file
<li>
Start eclipse by running the eclipse command or clicking eclipse application from the file manager
<li>
